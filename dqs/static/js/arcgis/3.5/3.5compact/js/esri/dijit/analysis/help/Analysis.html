        <hr/>
        <p>Being able to identify, quantify, and visualize spatial patterns in your data can help you answer many questions. These tools examine incident concentrations or idenfity any areas of statistically significant clusters.
            <ul>
                <li>Explore Correlations lets you to examine the strength of relationships between feature values.
                </li>
                <li>The Find Hot Spots tool identifies statistically signficant clustering of incidents (robberies, trees) or of high and low attribute values (total sales, census tract populations).  Use this tool to find unexpected clusters of high and low crime densities, traffic accidents, home values, unemployment or biodiversity, for example.

            <p>Density analysis takes known quantities of some phenomenon and
spreads them across the landscape based on the quantity that is
measured at each location.  For example, you might have a point value for each town representing the total number of people in the town, but you want to learn more about the spread of population over the region. Since all the people in each town do not live at the population point, by calculating density, you can create a surface showing the predicted distribution of the population throughout the landscape.

        <h2>Interpolate Values</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>Interpolation is the process of predicting values
between known sample points to create a continuous surface of values.
There are many continuous features in geography such as elevation and rainfall.  It is rarely possible to gather samples for all
locations,  so interpolation is used to calculate values for places with no sample values.

                <i>State_Name</i> attribute, you can dissolve boundaries using the
                <i>State_Name</i> attribute.  Adjacent counties will be merged together if they have the same value for
                <i>State_Name</i>.  The end result is a layer of state boundaries.  You can also summarize attributes for the merged feature.  For example, if each county had a
                <i>Population</i> attribute, you could calculate the sum of
                <i>Population</i> for the state.

            <p>Overlay combines two or more layers into one single layer.  You can think of overlay as peering through a stack of maps and creating a single map containing all the information found in the stack.   In fact, before the advent of GIS, cartographers would literally copy maps onto clear acetate sheets, overlay
these sheets on a light table,  and hand draw a  new map from the overlaid
data.
 Overlay is much more than a merging of line
work; all the attributes of the features taking part in the overlay
are carried through to the final product. Overlay is used to answer one of the most basic questions of geography, &quot;what is on top of what?&quot; For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        What parcels are within the 100-year floodplain? (Within is just another way of saying on top of.)
                          
                    </li>
                    <li>What roads are within what counties?
                    </li>
                    <li>What land use is on top of what soil type?
                         
                    </li>
                    <li>What wells are within abandoned military bases?

        <p>
            <b>Summarize Data</b> tools calculate total counts, lengths, areas, and basic descriptive statistics (average, minimum, maximum, and so on) of attributes for features within areas or near to other features.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Aggregate Points</b> calculates statistics about  points that fall within specified areas.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Summarize Nearby</b> calculates the sum, count, average, minimum, or maximum values for attributes within a specified  distance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Summarize Within</b> calculates the sum, count, average, minimum, or maximum values for attributes of area features that overlap each other.

            <p>This tool works with a layer of
point features (the analysis layer) and a layer of area features. It first
figures out which points fall within each area. After determining
this point-in-area spatial relationship, statistics about all
points in the area are calculated and assigned to the area. The
most basic statistic is the count of the number of points within
the area, but you can get other statistics as well.

            <p>This tool finds features that are within a chosen distance of features in the analysis layer.  Distance can be measured as a straight-line distance or a drive time distance (for example, within 10 minutes).  Statistics are then calculated for the nearby features.  For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Calculate the total population within five minutes of a proposed new store location.
                    </li>
                    <li>Calculate the number of freeway access ramps within five minutes of a proposed new store location to use as a measure of store accessibility.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p>This tool finds areas (and portions of areas) that overlap between two
layers and calculates statistics about the overlap. For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Given a layer of watershed areas and a layer of land-use areas by land-use type, calculate total acreage of land-use type for each watershed. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Given a layer of parcels in a county and a layer of city boundaries, summarize the average value of vacant parcels within each city.
                    </li>

        <h2>Use Proximity</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>One of the most common  questions posed in spatial analysis is &quot;what is near what?&quot;  For example:
            <ul>
                <li>How
close is this well to a landfill?
                    

                </li>
                <li>Do
any roads pass within 1,000 meters of a stream?
                    




                </li>
                <li>What is the shortest street network route from some location to
another?
                    

                </li>
            </ul>
            The Use Proximity tools measure distance using straight lines or by using street network distance or travel time.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Create Buffers</b> create areas of equal distance from

            <p>A buffer is an area that covers a given distance from a point, line, or area feature. 
            </p>
            <p>Buffers are typically used to create areas that can be further analyzed using a tool such as Overlay Layers. For example, if the question is &quot;What buildings are within one mile of the school?&quot;, the answer can be found by creating a one-mile buffer around the school and overlaying the buffer with the layer containing building footprints.  The end result is a layer of  those buildings within one mile of the school.

            <p>This tool measures the cost of traveling between incidents and facilities and
determines which are nearest to one other. The result is a layer showing the best routes between incidents and
facilities along with the  travel cost (time and distance) of each route.  For example, you can use this tool to find the closest hospital to an accident or the closest ATM to your current location.
